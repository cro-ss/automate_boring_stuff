### Some projects are created in this repository, in order to enhance and demonstrate my pyhton abilities
1. Data Detection
  -  When I have used regex and functions, loops, conditions and so on.
  -  The project is able to recognize dates from large texts and to evaluate them if they are correct even in leap years
2. Strong Password Detection
    - Using regex, functions and loops to evaluate a strong passwords.
    - The program will ask you until you fullfill all the strong password requirements
4. Sandwich Maker
  -  Using input validation pyinput we create a straigthforward way to ask for a sandwich
  -  I have used menus, yes or not input, intinput and so on. My goal is to avoid complicated input code, it better to use pre-worked libraries
